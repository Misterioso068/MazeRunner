MazeRunner
A simple C++ maze game using SDL3 and OpenGL.

Requirements:
    C++ compiler supporting C++11 (tested with g++)

    Make (or mingw32-make on Windows)

    SDL3 development libraries

    OpenGL development libraries
    GLEW development libraries (for OpenGL function loading)

Setup:
    Download SDL3, OpenGL, and GLEW libraries for your platform.

    Copy headers to the following structure in your project:

    include/SDL3/
    include/GL/


    Copy libraries (.lib or .a) to:

    lib/SDL3/
    lib/GL/


    Windows only: 
    Copy DLLs from SDL3/OpenGL to the dll/ folder.

    The Makefile will automatically copy DLLs from dll/ to build/debug/ when you build.

Build:
    From the project root:

    make

    This will:

    Compile all src/*.cpp files into build/debug/obj/

    Link them into build/debug/mazerunner.exe

    Copy any required DLLs into build/debug/

    Run

    On Windows:

    ./build/debug/mazerunner.exe

Cleaning Build Files:
    make clean

    This removes all .o files and the executable.
